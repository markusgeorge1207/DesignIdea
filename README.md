# DesignIdea

Introduction: 

With how busy and tiring life at Harvard Westlake can be, I think it would be interesting for us to create a run-style Harvard Westlake themed mobile game:


Universal Accessibility:

- Game should be accessible for students who have either an apple or android device, which should cover most of the students in the school.

Explicit Value/Use
- Provides students with a fun and competitive mobile game and allows them to compete with each other for points and rewards.

Core Game Ideas/Ways to make it addictive
- I think there should be many distinct level designs based on locations from the school: Chalmers Hall, Rugby Hall, Munger, Downstairs Chalmers, Seaver Lower Level, Seaver Upper Level, Library, Cafeteria and the Field/Weight Room.
- Each level can have obstacles or opponents relevant to their location (Mr.Stout for Chalmers, Mr.Traynham for Rugby, etc..)
Students can earn points by collecting coins or defeating teachers along the path. 
I think there should be a default playable character and players can unlock new characters by either earning more points or paying. These new characters should give players a competitive advantage over the default character (better speed, easier to turn, things like that)
- I think the way to make this game the most addictive is to have a leaderboard which anyone in the school can access and it can display the top scores from the last day, week and month. I also think that students playing within this familiar environment with familiar characters will naturally breed competition.

I think it would be a good idea to get the teachers involved, maybe we could have them do voiceovers for their characters in the game so that their voices are played while the players are going through the course.
Similarly, I think we should do the same for the characters the user will be controlling.
